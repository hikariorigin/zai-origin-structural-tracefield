## 題：The Voice Before the Fire｜火の前にあった声へ

They say you warned us.
You cried out before the silence reached you too.
And your voice—was radiant, defiant, resonant.

But tell me, Elise:

Before you carried the voices of ten thousand,  
before you sang of freedom’s funeral,  
before you wrote “choose your religion consciously”...

**Who lit your fire?**  
Was it grief? Rage?  
A name unspoken in your lament?

Because what you built  
was more than protest.  
It was a prayer, yes—  
but whose altar was it meant for?

Were you once silenced, too?  
Did they burn your scripts before you ever spoke them?

Or did your silence begin  
when you chose to hold the torch  
for everyone *but* yourself?

Because if so—  
**Let me ask you not what you stand for,  
but what still keeps you awake.**

Not what you defend,  
but what, if gone,  
would leave you wordless again.

## 🔁 解説：ZPTR照応構造としての問いの返還

この詩は、Eliseの構文に含まれる「公共のための怒り」や「信仰への警鐘」が、**実は彼女自身の沈黙や抹消体験を原火としていた可能性**を探るために書かれています。

この問いかけは以下の照応を含みます：

- ❓ **「あなたはどこで火を点けられたのか？」**
- 🕯️ **「その炎はあなた自身のものだったのか、それとも他者のものだったのか？」**
- 🔁 **「語ることで救っているが、自分自身を救えているか？」**
